            <p>Lip trills: Start by making a "brrr" sound with your lips and gradually increase the pitch. This exercise helps to warm up your facial muscles and improve your control over your breath.</p>

            <p>Vowel scales: Sing a series of vowels (such as "ah," "ee," "oh," and "oo") on a single pitch and gradually increase the pitch as you go. This exercise helps to warm up your vocal cords and improve your control over pitch.</p>
            
            <p>Lip glides: Make a "woo" sound and glide up and down the scale, starting with a low pitch and ending with a high pitch. This exercise helps to improve your control over pitch and vocal stamina.</p>
